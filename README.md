# POC (Proof of concept) of the Micro programming language

The `Micro` programming language aims to be a minimal, highly expandable language where you are free to define how it should behave to fit your specific needs.

`Key features to be proven feasible`

</div>

### :arrow_forward: Minimal syntax

- The Micro language should have a bare-bones syntax with minimal boilerplate.
- No assumptions about what features the end user desires in their use-cases for the language.

### :arrow_forward: Macros
- Allow the implementation of new keywords and features.
- Meta-Programming capabilities to expand, modify, and implement features of the Micro Language.

### :arrow_forward: Rules
- To allow deep modification of how the code should compile and behave.
- Condition -> Result structures to modify the behavior of the compiler and enable custom syntax.
